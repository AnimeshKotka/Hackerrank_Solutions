# Hackerrank_Solutions
This repository contains solutions to questions on hackerrank contests. 
These are the the solutions that either I submitted in the contest or designed it myself.
Few solutions are not 100% correct and may not fetch you full marks.
All solutions are posted as soon as the contest ends.
Most of the codes are in java, few in C and python as well.
